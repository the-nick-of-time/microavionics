Create random board
	for ships from longest to shortest:
		while a valid location is not found:
			x = choose random number between 0 and 7
			y = choose random number between 0 and 7
			orientation = x*y mod 4						//todo: check if this is evenly distributed; it seems like 0 is overrepresented
			while a valid orientation is not found:
				if no collision:
					a valid location was found
					a valid orientation was found
				else:
					orientation = orientation++ % 4;
					if orientation == x*y mod 4:
						// we have checked every orientation so this location doesn't work
						a valid location was not found
						break






ship object:
	length
	x
	y
	orientation


Cell object:
	is targeted?
	is occupied?

Board object:
	contains an array of 64 cell objects
	//contains all ship objects				//redundant, the cells have "occupied" flags which are good enough
